# Engineering 4 Notebook
This is where all of our stuff will go!


## Hello Python 

### Code
This is our code for Hello Python:  <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/lesson00.py>
### Lessons Learned
We learned how to make a "While" statement. We didn't know how to do user input at first, but we looked it up and and figured out which user input style was fit for our code.

## Python Calculator

   ### Code
This is our code for Python Calculator:  <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/lesson01.py>
  ### Lessons Learned
We did not realize that you could not use strings for math in python, so we had to return it as an integer. We were aslo supposed to round the quotient to two places and we didn't know how to do that. So we had to look up how to round in Python and it was easier than we thought, but it put the number two instead of rounding it to two places. We figured out that it was not supposed to be in the print but in the return instead.

## Python Quadractic Sovler
### Code
This is our code for Quadratic Solver: <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/QuadSolver.py>
### Lessons Learned
First we had to refresh our memories of what a discriminant was and how to solve them. We didn't know that we had to use an array for the quadradtic formula in order for it print both roots, but that was an easy fix. We had a hard time coming up with what to say when they got their roots.                  
 
## Python Strings and Loops
### Code
This is our code for Strings and Loops: <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/commit/fd9ca0cb6defa79b6f10a613690fd7ea57ba6a99>
### Lessons Learned
We learned about for loops and splits. This assingment was pretty easy and straight forward.

## Python Challenge MSP
### Code
This is our code for MSP: <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/commit/260a80c7ffa33686d39e95e8c9736155e21b2031>
### Lessons Learned
We learned how to use appends and at first we used a "break", but later deleted it because it didn't work with our code. We decided to wrote the guy row by row in a function which took a long time but was pretty easy to understand. We also had trouble seeing which words were guessed right and wrong and we also had problems with the corect letters going into the right blanks. Lines 15 and 16 is where we put the blanks.

## GPIO Bash
### Code 
gpio mode 0 out

gpio write 0 1
### Lessons Learned
In general, we did not have many struggles because the code was given to us, but we did need to remind ourselves of how to wire and LED and we had to look up the pin numbetrs because they are different from Arduino. Another thing we learned was a short cut to get to the manual. "man gpio" takes us to the Terminal GPIO manual page where we learned that "-g" allows us to use the numbers on the T-Cobbler.

## GPIO SSH
### Code
hostname -I

sudo raspi-config

.

.

gpio mode 0 out

gpio write 0 1
### Lessons Learned

## Hello Flask

### Code
This is our code for Hello Flask: <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Flask/gpio/app.py>
<https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Flask/gpio/app2.py>
### Lesssons Learned
We had some problems with both buttons working the messages displayed on both buttons befor and after they were clicked.

## GPIO- Flask
### Code 
This is our code for GPIO Pins- Flask <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Flask/gpio/templates/index.html>
### Lessons Learned


## GPIO- 12C
### Code
Here is our code for GPIO- 12C <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/12C.py>
