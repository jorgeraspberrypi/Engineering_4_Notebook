This is where all of our stuff will go!
# Hello Mathematica

# Hello Python 

## Code
This is our code for Hello Python  <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/lesson00.py>
## Lessons Learned
We learned how to make a "While" statement. We didn't know how to do user input at first, but we looked it up and and figured out which user input style was fit for our code.

# Python Calculator

## Code
This is our code for Python Calculator  <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/lesson01.py>
## Lessons Learned
We did not realize that you could not use strings for math in python, so we had to return it as an integer. We were aslo supposed to round the quotient to two places and we didn't know how to do that. So we had to look up how to round in Python and it was easier than we thought, but it put the number two instead of rounding it to two places. We figured out that it was not supposed to be in the print but in the return instead.

# Python Quadractic Sovler

## Code
This is our code for Quadratic Solver <https://github.com/jorgeraspberrypi/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/QuadSolver.py>
## Lessons Learned
First we had to refresh our memories of what a discriminant was and how to solve them. We didn't know that we had to use an array for the quadradtic formula in order for it print both roots, but that was an easy fix. We had a hard time coming up with what to say when they got their roots.
