# Your legacy
1. Actually do your work
2. Ask for help when you are stuck 
3. Remember to always have your SolidWorks ratio 1:1 and the dimensions are 3000 x 600
4. Talk to people other than your partner
5. You don't need to plug your pi into the ground, just use the USB and plug it directly in your computer.
